# Color Based Sorting Model

  This was an very interesting project as it was a basic model of what is implemented in the various industries
  such as food industry. This model was based on the basic principle of identifying the frequency and deciding what color 
  it is. We used a commonly available color-sensor to get the input as a frequency. The test color will give the least frequency,
  thus identified. After the detection, we used the step-motor to move the slots according the color and thus color sorted.
  
  It was not as simple as it seems, we faced some unique errors and issues and it took a lot more time than it must. But we 
  managed to resolve all of them. Please have a look at the documentation and have an insight of what we had implemented.
